# Scavenger Hunt
## Description
There is some interesting information hidden around this site http://mercury.picoctf.net:44070/. Can you find it?
## Hint
You should have enough hints to find the files, don't run a brute forcer.
## Solution
On pressing ctrl+shift+I or opening elements we can navigate to the sources where we can find a html file :which has ""Here's the first part of the flag: picoCTF{t""
<br> on navigating to the css file we get

/* CSS makes the page look nice, and yes, it also has part of the flag. Here's part 2: h4ts_4_l0 */
so we get the 2nd part
<br>on navigating to the myjs.js we get the hint/* How can I keep Google from indexing my website? */
<br>which led me to search about the methods to do so,which resulted in me finding about [robots.text](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/robots/intro)so if we 
go to the robots.txt of the website by adding/robots.txt to the webpage(http://mercury.picoctf.net:44070/robots.txt) 
```
we get the text <br>"User-agent: <br>
Disallow: /index.html<br>
#Part 3: t_0f_pl4c<br>
#I think this is an apache server... can you Access <br>the next flag?"<br>
```
so we got the third part and now have to access the apache server permission which can be accessed by replacing robots.txt by .htaccess 
which gives us
```
# Part 4: 3s_2_lO0k
# I love making websites on my Mac, I can Store a lot of information there.
```
here we get the 4th part
now if we replace .htaccess with .DS_Store we can view the file which stores  the configurations for how the desktop looks  and the data
```
Congrats! You completed the scavenger hunt. Part 5: _7a46d25d}
```
so our final flag is : <b>picoCTF{th4ts_4_l0t_0f_pl4c3s_2_lO0k_7a46d25d}   </b>
