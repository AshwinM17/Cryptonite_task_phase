We get the key: picoCTF{next_time_I'll_try_2_rounds_of_rot13_ZNMldSDw}


<b>Q2.Numbers:<br></b>
Image given:
![Alt text](the_numbers.png)
which is coded as A=1,B=2... and so on<br>
flag is:PICOCTF{THENUMBERSMASON}


<b>Q3.Caeser:<br></b>
on opening the downloaded file in notepad i recieved the text:<br>
picoCTF{ynkooejcpdanqxeykjrbdofgkq}<br>
in which the text wrapped in {} was encoded by caeser cipher,so checking on a online caeser cipher we could brute force this as there were only 25 possibilities,so we got the flag as picoCtf{crossingtherubiconvfhsjkou}
